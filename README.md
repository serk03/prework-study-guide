# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created a study guide to accompany the bootcamp that i am currently on, it was built to help myself understand the how HTML, CSS, Git, Github and JavaScript are used to build web apps.

This study guide helps track any notes that relate to these topics in a clear and concise way using the web.

It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.

I learnt how these technologies come together and how they are used to create web apps.
