        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <h3>Information about HTML</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development</li>
          <li> HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:
            <ul>
              <li>Text elements</li>
              <li>Image elements</li>
              <li>Header elements</li>
              <li>List elements</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
            <!-- <br></br> -->
             <li>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Meta-related element</li>
              <li>Content division elements</li>
              <li>Semantic elements</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>When we build a website, we build it step-by-step in much the same way as you build a house. First, we use HTML to build a sturdy frame, using HTML elements as our frame’s building blocks</li>
          <li>When we create the structure for our webpage, we use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets ("< >")</li>
          <li>These tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
          <li> However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the "head" and "body" elements.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>"head"</strong>  element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
              <ul>
                
                </ul>
                <ul>
                
              </ul>
              </li>
            
              <li>The <strong>"body"</strong>  element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
              
          </ul>
          
          <h2>The structure of a html document/ webpage</h2>
          <h3>!DOCTYPE</h3>
          <li>At the very top, we see the <strong>"!DOCTYPE html" </strong> declaration. This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. This particular "!DOCTYPE html" declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.
          </li>
          
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>"!DOCTYPE" </strong> is not case-sensitive because it is a declaration. Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
            </ul>
           
          
            <li> Next, we see the the "html" opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Inside the "html" tag is an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser the language for the webpage, in this case it is "English"</li>
              <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Head Element</h3>
            <li>
               
              <ul>
                <li>The <strong>"head"</strong> element contains the metadata for our web application.</li>
                <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
                <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
                <li>These elements that provide important information about a website to the browser, search engines, and other developers.</li>
                <li>Elements nested in the <strong>"head"</strong>  element, we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
              
                <ul>
                  <li>The "title" element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
                  <li><i>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing. Better SEO results in your website more frequently showing up in searches.</i>
                   
                      <li>The "head" element in this case defines the following three elements:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
                      <li>The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
                      <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
                      <li>Finally, the "title" of the webpage is defined.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <li>Other head tags</li>
                <ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
                  <li>The "base" element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                  <li>The "link" element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
                  <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                  <li>To learn more about other types of information that can be stored in the meta tag, visit the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">W3School page on the HTML meta tag</a></li>
                  <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </li> 
          <h3>The Body Element</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The body of an HTML document, includes the content that users see when they look at the webpage in a browser.</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
              <li><i>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. </i></li>
              <li><i>The element that holds all the children—in this case, the <strong>"body"</strong> element—is known as the strong>"parent"</strong>element.  </i></li>
              <li>This <strong>“parent/child”</strong> language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li> In the last section the only part that the user could see was the content in the "title" element</li>
            <li>The "body" element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the "body" element.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The "body" element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
              <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
                <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
                <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as "div" to create a division in the page, or "span" to create an inline division</li>
                <li> Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve. The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
            <li>These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash </li>
              <li> We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Important Information</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. </li>
              <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Headings Element</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
              <li>Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Paragraph Element</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Paragraph element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
              <li>You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Unordered/ Ordered List Elements</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>ul - element represent unordered lists, will display information as a normal bullet point</li>
              <li>ol - element represent ordered lists, will display information as a numbered bullet point </li>
              <li>li - element represent the list element must be wrapped by the ul/ol element</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Image Element</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The "img" element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
              <li>The "img" element can contain various attributes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li> The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
                <li>The "alt" attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>Break Line Element</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The "br" element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Anchor Tag Element</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The "a" element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
              <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
              
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Important Information</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that we use heading tags in order from "h1" to "h6" to make the page accessible to users who access the page using screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest heading,"h1", should only appear once on each page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Section Element</h4>
            <li>The "section" elements allow us to elegantly organize the content on our page based on the topics we have.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Important Information</h4>
          <li>We can see that each section element has an id attribute that also matches one of the four topics.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML uses the "id" attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This will make more sense once we start using CSS and JavaScript.</li>
              <li>You may have noticed the "class" attribute as well. For now, all you need to know is that this works in a similar way to the "id". We will learn more about the class attribute later.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Developers test code early and often to catch bugs. Sometimes testing can be as simple as looking for changes in the browser, like we are doing here, to see if the webpage is rendering as expected.</li>
          </ul>
          
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>•	Inline CSS.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. </li>
              <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
              <li>They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>•	Internal CSS</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
              <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
              <li>Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>External CSS</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
              <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To learn more about this principle, visit the Wikipedia article about separation of concerns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of concerns</a></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>CSS Rules:</h4>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. </li>
            <li>The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The padding property adds space around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger!</li>
            <li>That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Height - sets the height of an element, must use the px,%, em or rem</li>
          <li>Width- sets the width of an element, must use the px,%, em or rem</li>
          <li>Border – set a border around the element, must use the px,%, em or rem and set the color</li>
          <li>Box-shadow – set a shadow around the element, must use the px,%, em or rem and set the color</li>
          <br>
          <li>Assigning colours in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To find out more information on HTML Colours refer to the following: <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">html colour codes</a></li>
            <li>Take a look at the MDN Web Docs on CSSLinks to an external site. to see what other properties and values there are to try. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">MDN web docs properties and values</a></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>CSS Box Model:</h4>
          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
          <li>Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Refer to documentation for more information on box model: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">CSS Box Model</a></li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>CSS Properties:</h4>
          <li>* - Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
            <li>In this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties</li>
          </ul>
          <li>img - selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>Display - The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>Class attribute- Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
            <li>Represent by using the “.” In css followed by the class name.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>We can combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>e.g. header, footer{}</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h4>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY)</h4>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>

          <h4>Linking CSS to HTML:</h4>
          <li>Notice the <head> section, and recall that this is where we store metadata, which contains information about the webpage. This is where we will add the link to our style sheet.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css</li>
              <li>In the preceding statement, a link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
              <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
              <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html).</li>
                <li>To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.</li>
              </ul>

          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.
            <li>Git is the most commonly used version control software among developers and a tool that you will likely use on the job.</li>
            
              <li>To access Git, we use the command line.</li>
              <li>Git commands are not the same as the bash commands such as cd and mkdir that we use to navigate and create directories or perform other tasks. </li>
              <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code. </li>
              <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
              <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          
           
            </li>
          <h3>Git Commands</h3>
          <li>Git clone “ssh value” – this will clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modification in the current working branch to the staging area, informs Git that the changes will added in the next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "add starter code": allow you to enter commit message that describes what the commit contains </li>
          <li>git pull origin main: checks to see if the local branch is in sync with base branch</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>

          <li>Other git commands:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>git revert "SHA value": reverts the to previous version of code prior to bug or error </li>
          </ul>
          

          <li>For informaiton on git commands refer to: <a href="Git Command Cheat SheetLinks to an external site.">Git Command Cheat SheetLinks to an external site.</a> </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your JavaScript notes here</li>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
            <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a critical tool in every web developer's tool kit. You'll spend a little over half of your time in the boot camp on it, so let's begin our introduction now.</li>
            <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!</li>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript is written externally in a script.js file</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Insert the script tag just before the bottom body tag</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Declaring varibles using the following key words</li>
            <ul>
              <li>var</li>
              <li>const</li>
              <li>let</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
              <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Variable Types:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Strings - This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
                    <li>Number - This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
                    <li>Boolean - This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
                    <li>Arrays - This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
                      <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>e.g. var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
                      </ul>
                        <li>Being able to store a group of data in an array is a fundamental feature of JavaScript. Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
                        <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data.</li>
                        <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
                        <li>Arrays have a unique number built inside of them to identify the data.</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is know as an Index</li>
                          <li>Index's start from 0</li>
                          <li> The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
                          <li>To find out what data is in the array, use the array name followed by the index number e.g. shapes[0]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Object - This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
            <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>*/*/ - used for multi line comments</li>
                <li>// - for single line comments</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>  
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li> This means that we must be intentional about how we set up code in a JS file; we can’t just throw it all in there any which way!</li>
            <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Types of Conditionals:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If-Statements</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code.</li>
                  <li>Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>else if statements</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if. In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Loops - for loops, while loops</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
                  <li>Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>requirements for using loops:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>length of the array - use built in property "length"</li>
                      <li>starting point for loop, use x=0;</li>
                      <li>condition - "x"<"shapes.length;"</li>
                      <li>x++ - The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
                      <li>e.g. of for loop
                        <br>
                        for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
                          <br>
                          // code block
                          <br>
                         }
                      </li>

                    </ul>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
              Truth and Falsy:
              <ul>
                <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy.</li>
                <li>If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets.</li>
                <li>If the condition isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
                <li>Fasly values:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li> A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false</li>
                </ul>
                <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>To learn more about truthy and falsy values, visit the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy">MDN Web Docs on truthy</a></li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>Operators:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
            <ul>
              <h4>Types of Operators:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Addition - Add two numbers together or combine two strings.</li>
                <li>Subtraction, multiplication, division - These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.</li>
                <li>Assignment - As you've seen already: this assigns a value to a variable.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>= - assigns value to variable</li>
                  <li>== - comparison operator, not strict</li>
                  <li>=== - comparison operator, strict</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Strict Equality - This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.</li>
                <li>Not, Does-Not-equal - This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now. See Expressions and operators for a complete list.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h3>Functions:</h3>
          <br>
          <li>Are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute</li>
          <li>This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need.</li>
        
          <ul>
          <li>example of function:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              function helloWorld() {
                <br>
                // code block
                <br>
               }
            </li>
            <li>The code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets </li>
            <li>Remember to include the empty parentheses after the function name.</li>
            <li>Note that it is common practice to indent the for loop code below the function name, within the curly brackets, to add visual structure to your code</li>
          </ul>
          <li>You can wrap functions around code to make it more useful.</li>
          <li>In our examples we wrapped the if-statments/ else if statements and the loop in seperate functions</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
          <h4>Calling a function</h4>
          <li>Being able to call a function to execute it also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
          <li>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job.</li>
          <li>Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
          <li>The return statement tells the browser to return the result variable out of the function so it is available to use.</li>
          <li>This is necessary because variables defined inside functions are only available inside those functions.</li>
        </ul>
